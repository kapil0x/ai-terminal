Hi [Name],

I'm launching a beta test for AI Terminal, a VS Code extension that provides architecture-aware code suggestions. Unlike generic AI tools, it learns your project's patterns and gives specific, contextual advice.

I'd love your feedback as an experienced developer. The beta includes:
- Early access to all features
- Direct feedback channel to the development team
- Recognition as a beta contributor in the launch

Interested? It takes about 30 minutes to test and provide feedback.

Best,
[Your name]
```
