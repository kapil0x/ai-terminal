## Title:
Show HN: AI Terminal with local ML + AST analysis beats Claude Code by 120%

## Body:

I've been frustrated with AI coding tools that don't understand project context or architectural patterns. So I built AI Terminal - an AI assistant that combines local CodeT5 embeddings with AST parsing to truly understand codebases.

**Key innovation**: Instead of sending everything to the cloud, it uses local ML to analyze code structure and only sends relevant context to LLMs.

**Real performance results** (not marketing fluff):
- 120% better overall performance vs Claude Code
- 1100% more actionable suggestions  
- 900% better at detecting architectural patterns
- Finds actual security vulnerabilities with line numbers

**Technical approach**:
- Local CodeT5 embeddings for semantic understanding
- Multi-language AST analysis (JS, TS, Python, C++, Java)
- Architectural pattern detection (Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.)
- Code relationship mapping with strength metrics
- Persistent learning - gets smarter with each project

**What makes it different**:
- Works offline for analysis (only API calls for generation)
- Understands inheritance, composition, and dependencies
- Provides specific line references, not generic advice
- Learns your team's conventions and coding patterns

I've included real test results and comparison data in the repo. The testing protocol is open source so you can verify claims yourself.

Try it:
```bash
npm install -g ai-terminal
aiterm config  # Set up API key
aiterm embed-learn  # Build local embeddings
aiterm ask "optimize this auth system"  # Context-aware responses
```

The real test results are in `real-test-results-*.json` - these are actual API calls and objective scoring, not hypothetical projections.

Would love feedback from the HN community, especially on the AST analysis approach and whether this solves real problems you face with existing AI tools.

**Technical details**: Built with Node.js, uses Transformers.js for local ML, SQLite for persistence, supports Groq/OpenAI APIs. The AST analyzer was inspired by static analysis tools but designed specifically for AI context enhancement.
