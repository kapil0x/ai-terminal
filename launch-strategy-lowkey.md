# Low-Key Launch Strategy

## üéØ **Authentic Developer Marketing**

### **Core Messaging**
- Focus on **solving a real problem** not selling a product
- Share **technical approach** and implementation details  
- Be **honest about limitations** and rough edges
- **Ask for feedback** rather than promote features
- Position as **experiment/side project** not commercial product

### **Tone Guidelines**
‚úÖ "Been working on this side project..."
‚úÖ "Curious if others see value in..."
‚úÖ "Still rough around the edges, but..."
‚úÖ "Would love feedback on the approach..."

‚ùå "Revolutionary new tool!"  
‚ùå "Beats existing solutions by X%"
‚ùå "Will change how you code"
‚ùå Aggressive performance claims

## üìÖ **Rollout Plan**

### **Phase 1: Technical Communities (Week 1)**
**HackerNews** - Focus on technical implementation
- Post during peak hours (9-11am PT)
- Lead with problem statement, not solution claims
- Include GitHub link and real usage examples
- Engage authentically in comments

**Reddit Communities**:
- r/programming - Technical approach discussion
- r/MachineLearning - Local ML + AST parsing angle  
- r/webdev - Developer workflow improvement
- r/node - CLI tool showcase

### **Phase 2: Developer Social (Week 2)**  
**Twitter** - Share development journey
- Technical thread about implementation challenges
- Ask questions about approaches others have tried
- Share code snippets and demos organically
- Retweet and engage with related discussions

**Dev.to / Hashnode** - Technical deep-dive posts
- "Building a Context-Aware AI Coding Assistant"
- "Combining Local ML with AST Analysis" 
- "Why I Built My Own AI Tool (And What I Learned)"

### **Phase 3: Community Engagement (Week 3-4)**
**GitHub Discussions** - Open technical conversations
**Discord/Slack communities** - Share in relevant channels
**Podcasts** - Reach out for technical interview opportunities

## üìä **Success Metrics (Realistic)**

### **Primary Goals**
- 50-100 GitHub stars in first month
- 10-20 genuine users trying the tool
- 5-10 pieces of constructive feedback
- 2-3 technical discussions or PRs

### **Secondary Goals**  
- 1-2 blog posts or mentions by others
- Technical discussion on HN or Reddit
- Addition to awesome lists or tool collections

## üí¨ **Response Templates**

### **For Questions About Performance Claims**
"I tested it on my own projects and found it more helpful than generic suggestions, but YMMV. The comparison data is in the repo if you want to see the methodology."

### **For Technical Questions**
"Great question! Here's how that works... [technical explanation]. I'm still experimenting with this approach - curious what you think."

### **For Feature Requests**
"That's a really good idea. I hadn't considered that use case. Mind opening an issue on GitHub so I can think through the implementation?"

### **For Criticism**
"Fair points. This is definitely still experimental and has limitations. The [specific issue] is something I'm working on improving."

## üé™ **Platforms Priority**

### **Tier 1 (Primary Focus)**
1. **HackerNews** - Technical audience, authentic discussions
2. **GitHub** - Code discovery, developer community
3. **Reddit** (r/programming) - Developer discussions

### **Tier 2 (Secondary)**  
4. **Twitter** - Developer network, quick sharing
5. **Dev.to** - Technical blog posts
6. **Discord communities** - Organic sharing

### **Tier 3 (Future)**
7. **Product Hunt** - Only after establishing genuine users
8. **LinkedIn** - Professional network, later stage
9. **Conferences** - Speaking opportunities after traction

## üîß **Content Preparation**

### **Required Assets**
- [ ] README with clear, honest description
- [ ] Demo GIFs showing real usage (not perfect scenarios)  
- [ ] Technical documentation explaining approach
- [ ] Honest limitations and known issues section
- [ ] Contributing guidelines for community involvement

### **Nice-to-Have**
- [ ] Blog post about technical implementation
- [ ] Video walkthrough (casual, not polished)
- [ ] Comparison with existing tools (factual, not promotional)
- [ ] Roadmap based on actual user needs

The key is being **genuinely helpful** to the developer community rather than promotional. üöÄ
