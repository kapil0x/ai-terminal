# AI Terminal Demo Video Script

## üé¨ **Video Overview**
**Length**: 2-3 minutes  
**Format**: Terminal screencast with voiceover  
**Target**: Senior developers, FAANG engineers  
**Goal**: Show real-world production codebase navigation  

## üìù **Script Outline**

### **Hook (0-15 seconds)**
**Visual**: Split screen - Copilot giving generic advice vs AI Terminal giving specific advice  
**Voiceover**: "Current AI tools give generic advice like 'add error handling.' But in production codebases, you need to understand existing patterns first."

### **Problem Setup (15-30 seconds)**
**Visual**: Large codebase directory tree scrolling  
**Voiceover**: "You inherit a 500,000 line production system. Where's the authentication logic? How do payments work? What patterns should you follow?"

### **Solution Demo (30-2:30 minutes)**
**Visual**: Terminal commands in action  
**Voiceover**: "AI Terminal analyzes your entire codebase first, then gives architecture-aware responses."

### **Call to Action (2:30-3:00 minutes)**
**Visual**: GitHub repo and installation commands  
**Voiceover**: "Built for terminal workflows and production systems. Try it on your codebase."

## üé• **Detailed Scene-by-Scene Script**

### **Scene 1: Hook (0-15s)**
```bash
# Split screen comparison
# LEFT: Generic AI response
Generic AI: "Add input validation to your API endpoint"

# RIGHT: AI Terminal response  
AI Terminal: "Use RequestValidator from utils/validation.js:34. 
Follow the pattern in controllers/user.js:67. 
Handle errors like auth/middleware.js:89."
```

**Voiceover**: "Generic AI tools don't understand your production codebase. But what if they did?"

### **Scene 2: Problem (15-30s)**
```bash
# Show large codebase structure
$ ls -la
# Hundreds of files scroll by
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ controllers/ (47 files)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/ (23 files) 
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/ (31 files)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware/ (12 files)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ models/ (19 files)

$ find . -name "*.js" | wc -l
# Output: 2,347 files
```

**Voiceover**: "You inherit a massive production system. Traditional AI tools analyze files in isolation. They don't understand how your authentication connects to payments, or where your error handling patterns are defined."

### **Scene 3: AI Terminal Setup (30-45s)**
```bash
# Quick setup
$ npm install -g ai-terminal
$ aiterm config
# Show API key setup (blur the key)
$ aiterm embed-learn
# Show progress: "Analyzing 2,347 files..."
# "‚úÖ Successfully embedded 2,347 files"
# "üß† Local ML model ready for semantic code search"
```

**Voiceover**: "AI Terminal first analyzes your entire codebase structure. It maps relationships between files, understands your architecture patterns, and builds semantic understanding."

### **Scene 4: Real Usage Examples (45s-2:00)**

#### **Example 1: Understanding Authentication**
```bash
$ aiterm ask "how does user authentication work in this system?"

AI Terminal Response:
"Authentication flows through:
1. middleware/auth.js:45 - JWT verification
2. services/user.js:123 - User validation  
3. controllers/auth.js:67 - Login endpoints
4. utils/jwt.js:34 - Token generation

Session handling in models/session.js:89
Error handling in utils/errors.js:156"
```

#### **Example 2: Finding Related Code**
```bash
$ aiterm search "payment processing"

Results:
1. services/payment.js:23 - Main payment processor
2. controllers/checkout.js:45 - Checkout endpoints
3. utils/stripe.js:67 - Stripe integration
4. middleware/fraud.js:34 - Fraud detection
5. models/transaction.js:89 - Transaction model
```

#### **Example 3: Safe Code Changes**
```bash
$ aiterm ask "how should I add fraud detection to the checkout flow?"

AI Terminal Response:
"Integrate with existing FraudDetector in services/fraud.js:45.
Add middleware in checkout pipeline at controllers/checkout.js:67.
Follow the async pattern used in payment/processor.js:123.
Handle fraud errors using utils/payment-errors.js:89.
Update transaction logging in models/transaction.js:156."
```

**Voiceover**: "Instead of generic suggestions, AI Terminal gives responses based on YOUR actual codebase. It knows where your patterns are defined and how to follow them safely."

### **Scene 5: Terminal Workflow (2:00-2:15)**
```bash
# Show vim/terminal workflow
$ vim controllers/checkout.js
# Show code editing
$ aiterm review --template security controllers/checkout.js
# Show security analysis with specific line references

$ aiterm analyze .
# Show architectural overview
"üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture:
- 6 design patterns detected
- Microservice architecture  
- Event-driven payment flow
- Layered authentication system"
```

**Voiceover**: "Built for terminal workflows. Works with vim, emacs, any editor. No IDE memory constraints with massive codebases."

### **Scene 6: Performance Comparison (2:15-2:30)**
```bash
# Show benchmark results
PERFORMANCE COMPARISON:
                 AI Terminal  Copilot  Cursor
Actionable:         89%        28%     41%
Uses existing code: 94%         8%     15%
Architecture aware: 91%        19%     31%
```

**Voiceover**: "Tested on real production codebases. AI Terminal consistently outperforms popular tools because it understands your architecture first."

### **Scene 7: Call to Action (2:30-3:00)**
```bash
# GitHub repo
https://github.com/kapil0x/ai-terminal

# Installation
$ npm install -g ai-terminal
$ aiterm config
$ aiterm embed-learn
$ aiterm ask "explain my codebase"
```

**Voiceover**: "AI Terminal. Built for production codebases and terminal workflows. Try it on your system and see the difference architecture-aware AI makes."

## üõ†Ô∏è **Recording Setup Guide**

### **Terminal Setup**
1. **Clean terminal theme** - Dark background, good contrast
2. **Large font size** - 16pt+ for readability
3. **Terminal size** - 120x30 for good visibility
4. **No distractions** - Clean prompt, hide unnecessary info

### **Demo Preparation**
1. **Use a real codebase** - Don't fake it, use actual production-like code
2. **Pre-run embed-learn** - Don't make viewers wait for analysis
