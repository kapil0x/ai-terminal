**Title:** Show HN: CLI tool for understanding and navigating large legacy codebases with AI

**Body:**

Anyone who's worked with large legacy codebases knows the pain: trying to understand how a 500k+ line system works, finding where specific functionality lives, or safely making changes without breaking things.

I built a terminal-based AI assistant specifically for this problem.

**The approach**: Instead of generic AI suggestions, it learns your entire codebase structure first:
- Builds semantic understanding of your project (local ML + AST parsing)
- Maps relationships between files, classes, and functions
- Provides AI responses based on YOUR actual code architecture
- Works completely offline for analysis (only API calls for generation)

**Real-world example** from a legacy Node.js API I work with:
- Question: "How does user authentication work in this system?"
- Response: "Authentication flows through middleware/auth.js:45 ‚Üí utils/jwt.js:23 ‚Üí models/User.js:156. The session handling is in routes/auth.js:89-120. Related error handling in utils/errors.js:67."

**Why terminal/CLI**:
- Works with ANY editor/IDE (vim, emacs, VS Code, IntelliJ)
- Scriptable and automatable for CI/CD workflows
- Fast navigation through massive codebases
- No need to load entire projects in memory like IDEs

**Core commands**:
```bash
aiterm embed-learn          # Analyze entire codebase structure
aiterm search "payment flow" # Semantic search across all files
aiterm ask "explain the auth system"
aiterm review --template security legacy-endpoint.js
aiterm analyze .            # Full architectural overview
```

**Technical details**:
- Uses CodeT5 embeddings when available (falls back gracefully)
- Multi-language AST parsing (JS/TS, Python, Java, C++, C#)
- SQLite for persistent project knowledge
- Supports any OpenAI-compatible API

Built this because I was tired of spending hours just trying to understand code structure before I could even start working. The local analysis approach seems particularly valuable for large, undocumented systems.

Curious if others face similar challenges with legacy codebases and whether this type of tooling would be helpful.

### r/programming (Legacy Focus)
**Title**: CLI tool for understanding large legacy codebases using local AI analysis

**Body**:
Working with legacy codebases is painful. You inherit a 300k+ line system with minimal documentation, and spend weeks just trying to understand how things connect.

Built a terminal tool that specifically addresses this:

**The problem it solves**:
- "Where is the payment processing logic?" 
- "How do these 50 microservices communicate?"
- "What will break if I change this function?"
- "Where are all the places user data is validated?"

**How it works**:
1. Analyzes your entire codebase structure locally (AST + ML embeddings)
2. Builds semantic understanding of relationships
3. Provides AI responses based on YOUR actual architecture
4. Works with any editor (vim, emacs, VS Code, etc.)

**Example output**:
```bash
$ aiterm search "database connection"
Found in 12 files:
- config/database.js:23 (main connection pool)
- utils/db.js:45 (connection helper functions)  
- models/*.js (15 model files using connections)
- tests/db-setup.js:67 (test database setup)
```

**Why CLI instead of IDE extension**:
- Works with ANY development environment
- Handles massive codebases without memory issues
- Scriptable for automation and CI workflows
- Faster than loading entire projects in IDEs

GitHub: https://github.com/kapil0x/ai-terminal

Has been incredibly helpful for the legacy systems I maintain. Curious if others have similar pain points with large codebases.

### r/ExperiencedDevs
**Title**: Tool for navigating inherited legacy codebases - would love senior dev feedback

**Body**:
Senior devs - you know the drill. You inherit a massive legacy system, minimal docs, original devs long gone. Spend your first month just trying to understand what does what.

I built a CLI tool specifically for this scenario. Would love feedback from others who've been in this situation.

**The core problem**: Traditional AI tools give generic advice. But when you're working with legacy code, you need to understand the existing patterns and architecture first.

**What it does**:
- Scans entire codebase to understand structure and relationships
- Semantic search across all files ("show me all authentication code")
- AI responses that reference your actual existing code
- Architecture analysis to understand design patterns being used

**Real example** from a legacy e-commerce system:
Instead of generic "add input validation", it says: "Use the existing ProductValidator.validate() from utils/validation.js:45, similar to how it's implemented in controllers/product.js:123"

**Terminal/CLI benefits for large systems**:
- No memory constraints like IDEs with huge projects
- Works with vim/emacs workflows
- Scriptable for automated documentation
- Fast semantic search across millions of lines

```bash
aiterm embed-learn    # One-time: learn the codebase
aiterm ask "explain the order processing flow"
aiterm search "payment integration" 
aiterm review --template security payment-handler.js
```

GitHub: https://github.com/kapil0x/ai-terminal

Has this type of workflow been valuable for others dealing with legacy systems? Any features that would be particularly useful?

### r/devops  
**Title**: CLI tool for understanding infrastructure and deployment code in large systems

**Body**:
DevOps folks - how do you quickly understand deployment pipelines and infrastructure code when joining a new team or inheriting a complex system?

Built a CLI tool that helps with exactly this problem:

**Common scenarios**:
- "How does the CI/CD pipeline work?"
- "Where are environment configurations defined?"
- "What happens when this service fails?"
- "How do these Docker containers communicate?"

**What it does**:
- Analyzes infrastructure code (Terraform, Kubernetes YAML, Docker, CI configs)
- Maps relationships between services and deployments
- Provides context-aware explanations of your actual setup
- Works across multiple repos and complex directory structures

**Example**:
```bash
$ aiterm ask "explain the production deployment process"
> Production deploys through:
> 1. .github/workflows/deploy.yml:34 (triggers on main branch)
> 2. Uses terraform/prod/main.tf:67 for infrastructure
> 3. Deploys containers defined in docker/Dockerfile.prod:12
> 4. Health checks via kubernetes/prod/health-check.yaml:23
```

**Why CLI for DevOps**:
- Works in terminal-based workflows
- Handles multi-repo setups and complex directory structures
- No need to load massive Kubernetes configs in IDEs
- Scriptable for automated documentation

Curious if others would find this helpful for understanding inherited infrastructure setups.

### Legacy Codebase Focus
```
üßµ The worst part of being a developer? Inheriting a massive legacy codebase with zero documentation.

You spend weeks just trying to figure out where things are, how they connect, what you can safely change.

I built a CLI tool specifically for this pain. 1/7

The problem with current AI tools: they give generic advice without understanding YOUR codebase.

"Add error handling" - but I already have an ErrorHandler class buried somewhere in 500k lines of code.

I need to understand the existing patterns first. 2/7

So I built something different:
‚Ä¢ Analyzes your entire codebase structure locally
‚Ä¢ Maps relationships between files/functions/classes  
‚Ä¢ Provides AI responses based on YOUR actual architecture
‚Ä¢ Works in terminal (vim/emacs friendly)
‚Ä¢ Handles massive codebases without choking 3/7

Real example from a legacy e-commerce system:

‚ùå Generic AI: "Add payment validation"
‚úÖ My tool: "Use PaymentValidator.validate() from utils/payment.js:67, like in checkout/process.js:123"

It knows the existing code patterns. 4/7

Why CLI instead of IDE extension?
‚Ä¢ Works with ANY editor (vim, emacs, VS Code, etc.)
‚Ä¢ No memory issues with huge projects
‚Ä¢ Terminal-based workflows for senior devs
‚Ä¢ Scriptable for automation
‚Ä¢ Fast semantic search across millions of lines 5/7

Core workflow:
```bash
aiterm embed-learn    # Learns your codebase once
aiterm search "authentication"  # Find all auth-related code
aiterm ask "explain the payment flow"
aiterm review --template security old-endpoint.js
``` 6/7

GitHub: https://github.com/kapil0x/ai-terminal

Has been a game-changer for the legacy systems I maintain. 

Anyone else deal with inherited codebases and think this type of tooling would be helpful? 7/7
```

### Enterprise/Terminal Focus
```
üßµ Hot take: IDE-based AI tools aren't great for enterprise development.

When you're dealing with 500k+ line codebases, microservices, and legacy systems, you need different tooling.

Here's why I built a CLI-first AI assistant for code: 1/6

Enterprise dev reality:
‚Ä¢ Multiple repos, massive codebases
‚Ä¢ Mix of languages and frameworks
‚Ä¢ Legacy code with minimal docs
‚Ä¢ Terminal-based workflows (vim/emacs)
‚Ä¢ Need to understand existing patterns before changing anything 2/6

IDE limitations with large systems:
‚Ä¢ Memory issues loading huge projects
‚Ä¢ Slow indexing and search
‚Ä¢ Can't handle multi-repo setups well
‚Ä¢ AI suggestions ignore your actual architecture

CLI advantages:
‚Ä¢ Works with any editor
‚Ä¢ Handles massive codebases efficiently
‚Ä¢ Scriptable and automatable 3/6

My approach: Local analysis + AI context

```bash
aiterm embed-learn       # One-time: analyze entire codebase
aiterm search "payment"  # Semantic search across all files
aiterm ask "explain auth flow"  # AI responses using YOUR code
aiterm review legacy.js --template security
``` 4/6

Example from a legacy banking API:
Instead of "add validation", it says: "Use TransactionValidator from utils/validation.js:34, like in transfer/process.js:89"

It references the ACTUAL existing patterns in your codebase. 5/6

GitHub: https://github.com/kapil0x/ai-terminal

Built for enterprise devs who need to understand and modify large, complex systems.

Terminal + AI feels like the right combination for serious development work. 6/6
```
