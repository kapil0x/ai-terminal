**Title:** Show HN: Built an AI coding assistant that actually understands project context

**Body:**
I got tired of AI tools giving generic suggestions like "add error handling" without understanding my actual codebase. So I built something that combines local ML analysis with AST parsing to provide context-aware help.

**The core idea**: Instead of sending entire files to LLMs, analyze code structure locally first, then send only relevant context for intelligent responses.

**What it does**:
- Builds local embeddings of your codebase (uses CodeT5 when available)
- Parses AST to understand classes, functions, and relationships  
- Provides suggestions based on your actual architecture patterns
- Works with multiple languages (JS/TS, Python, C++, Java)

**Example difference**:
- Generic AI: "Add input validation"
- This tool: "Use the validateEmail() from UserValidator.js:23 like in registration.js:45"

**Technical bits**:
- Node.js CLI + VS Code extension
- Uses Transformers.js for local ML (falls back gracefully)
- SQLite for persistent project knowledge
- Supports Groq/OpenAI APIs for generation

**Try it**:
```bash
npm install -g ai-terminal
aiterm config  # API key setup
aiterm embed-learn  # Learn your codebase
aiterm ask "how should I structure this feature?"
```

GitHub: https://github.com/kapil0x/ai-terminal

Still rough around the edges, but it's been helpful for my projects. The local analysis approach seems promising - curious if others have tried similar techniques or see value in this direction.

Happy to discuss the technical implementation or get feedback on whether this addresses real pain points you've experienced.

### r/programming
**Title**: Built a CLI tool that combines local ML with AST parsing for better AI code assistance

**Body**:
Been working on this side project because I was frustrated with AI tools not understanding project context. The idea is to analyze code structure locally first, then use that for smarter AI interactions.

Key features:
- Local semantic analysis of your codebase
- AST parsing for understanding code relationships  
- Context-aware AI responses instead of generic suggestions
- CLI + VS Code extension

Example: Instead of "add error handling", it might suggest "use the ErrorHandler from utils/errors.js:15 like in auth/login.js:42"

GitHub: https://github.com/kapil0x/ai-terminal

Still experimenting with the approach, but curious if others see value in local analysis + AI rather than just sending everything to cloud models.

### r/MachineLearning  
**Title**: Combining CodeT5 embeddings with AST analysis for code understanding

**Body**:
Working on a project that uses local ML (CodeT5 when available) combined with traditional AST parsing to understand codebases before sending context to LLMs.

**Approach**:
1. Generate embeddings for code files using CodeT5 or fallback models
2. Parse AST to extract classes, functions, dependencies
3. Build semantic search index of project
4. Use this context to make AI responses more specific

**Results so far**:
- Much more relevant suggestions compared to sending raw files
- Able to reference specific existing patterns in codebase
- Works offline for analysis, only needs API for generation

**Technical details**:
- Uses Transformers.js for client-side ML
- SQLite for persistent project knowledge
- Supports multiple languages through language-specific AST parsers

GitHub: https://github.com/kapil0x/ai-terminal

Curious about feedback on the approach - has anyone tried similar combinations of local ML + traditional static analysis?

### r/webdev
**Title**: Made a tool that learns your project patterns for better AI coding help

**Body**:
Sharing a side project I've been working on. Got tired of AI tools that don't understand my actual codebase structure, so built something that learns project patterns first.

**What it does**:
- Scans your codebase to understand architecture
- Learns your coding patterns and conventions
- Gives AI suggestions based on your actual code, not generic examples

**Example**: 
- Before: "You should add validation"  
- After: "Use UserValidator.validateEmail() from utils/validation.js:23 like in components/SignupForm.js:45"

Works with React, Vue, vanilla JS, TypeScript, etc. Also has VS Code extension for inline suggestions.

GitHub: https://github.com/kapil0x/ai-terminal

Still polishing it, but has been helpful for my projects. Would love feedback from other developers on whether this addresses pain points you've experienced.

## üê¶ Twitter Threads

### Option 1: Technical Focus
```
üßµ Been working on a side project to solve a frustrating problem with AI coding tools.

The issue: AI gives generic advice because it doesn't understand your actual codebase structure.

So I built something that analyzes your project locally first, then uses that for smarter AI interactions. 1/6

The approach:
‚Ä¢ Parse AST to understand classes, functions, relationships
‚Ä¢ Build local embeddings of your code (CodeT5 when available)  
‚Ä¢ Create semantic search index of project patterns
‚Ä¢ Use this context for AI responses instead of sending raw files 2/6

Example difference:
‚ùå Generic: "Add input validation"
‚úÖ Context-aware: "Use validateEmail() from UserValidator.js:23 like in registration.js:45"

It actually references your existing code patterns. 3/6

Technical stack:
‚Ä¢ Node.js CLI + VS Code extension
‚Ä¢ Transformers.js for local ML
‚Ä¢ SQLite for persistent project knowledge
‚Ä¢ Supports Groq/OpenAI APIs

Works with JS/TS, Python, C++, Java 4/6

Still rough around the edges, but it's been helpful for my projects. The local analysis approach feels promising.

GitHub: https://github.com/kapil0x/ai-terminal

```bash
npm install -g ai-terminal
aiterm embed-learn  # learns your codebase
aiterm ask "optimize this component"
``` 5/6

Curious if others have tried similar approaches or see value in local analysis + AI rather than just cloud-based tools.

Happy to discuss the technical implementation or get feedback! 6/6
```

### Option 2: Problem-First Approach  
```
üßµ Real talk: AI coding tools frustrate me.

They suggest "add error handling" without knowing I already have an ErrorHandler class.

They recommend patterns I'm already using.

They don't understand my project's architecture.

So I built something different. 1/5

The idea: Analyze code structure locally FIRST, then use AI.

‚Ä¢ Parse AST to map classes, functions, dependencies
‚Ä¢ Build semantic understanding of your codebase  
‚Ä¢ Send relevant context to AI, not entire files
‚Ä¢ Get suggestions that reference your actual code 2/5

Example:
Instead of "use try-catch"
‚Üí "Use ErrorHandler.logAndNotify() from utils/errors.js:15 like in auth/login.js:42"

It knows your existing patterns. 3/5

Built as CLI + VS Code extension:
```bash
aiterm embed-learn  # learns your project
aiterm ask "how should I handle errors here?"
aiterm review myfile.js --template security
```

GitHub: https://github.com/kapil0x/ai-terminal 4/5

Still polishing it, but the local analysis approach feels right. 

Curious what others think - is this a real problem worth solving? 5/5
```
