Consider using a more robust error handling mechanism, such as a centralized error handler or a promise-based approach.\n* Line 131-150: The `chat` command is implemented using a complex series of `readline` prompts, which can lead to performance issues if the user input is slow or malformed. Consider using a more robust input validation library or a WebSockets-based approach for real-time communication.\n* The code uses several synchronous file I/O operations, which can lead to performance issues if the file system is slow or congested. Consider using asynchronous file I/O operations or caching mechanisms to improve performance.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be well-structured and maintainable, but there are some security and performance issues that need to be addressed. Additionally, there are opportunities for code refactoring and optimization to improve the overall quality and reliability of the application.\n",
