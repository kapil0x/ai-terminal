**Title:** I built an AI coding assistant that actually understands architecture (120% better than Claude Code)

**Body:**

I was tired of AI tools giving generic advice without understanding my project's context. So I spent months building AI Terminal - an AI assistant that combines local ML embeddings with AST parsing.

**The difference is huge:**

Traditional AI: "Add error handling"  
AI Terminal: "Line 67: Missing rate limiting in auth endpoint. Consider TokenBucket pattern like auth/limiter.js:23. Current complexity: 8/10, refactor validateUser() method."

**Technical approach:**
- Local CodeT5 embeddings for semantic understanding
- Multi-language AST analysis for architectural insights
- Pattern detection (Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.)
- Code relationship mapping with strength metrics
- Persistent project learning

**Real performance results** (objective testing, not marketing):
- 120% better overall performance vs Claude Code
- 1100% more actionable suggestions
- 900% better architectural pattern recognition
- Specific line references instead of generic advice

**What makes it different:**
- Hybrid local + cloud architecture (privacy-first)
- Understands inheritance, composition, dependencies
- Learns your team's conventions and patterns
- Works offline for analysis (only API calls for generation)

**GitHub:** https://github.com/kapil0x/ai-terminal
**Real test data:** Included in repo - verify claims yourself

The testing protocol is open source. You can reproduce all results.

```bash
npm install -g ai-terminal
aiterm config
aiterm embed-learn
aiterm ask "optimize this component"
```

**Tech stack:** Node.js, Transformers.js, SQLite, supports Groq/OpenAI APIs

Thoughts? Is this the direction AI coding tools should go?

**Title:** Hybrid Local + Cloud AI for Code Analysis: 120% Performance Improvement [Research]

**Body:**

**Paper/Project:** AI Terminal - Combining Local ML Embeddings with LLM Generation for Code Analysis

**Abstract:** Most AI coding assistants rely purely on cloud LLMs without local intelligence. We built a hybrid system using local CodeT5 embeddings + AST analysis combined with cloud generation, achieving 120% performance improvement over baseline tools.

**Key Contributions:**
1. **Local semantic understanding** using CodeT5 embeddings for context selection
2. **AST-powered architectural analysis** for design pattern detection  
3. **Hybrid architecture** balancing privacy, speed, and capability
4. **Objective evaluation framework** with reproducible benchmarks

**Methodology:**
- Local: CodeT5 feature extraction, AST parsing, relationship mapping
- Cloud: Context-enhanced prompts to LLMs (Groq/OpenAI)
- Evaluation: 5 scenarios, objective scoring across accuracy/specificity/actionability

**Results:**
```
Overall Performance: +120.2%
Actionability: +1100% (specific vs generic advice)
Pattern Recognition: +900% (architectural insights)
Context Awareness: +150% (project-specific understanding)
```

**Technical Details:**
- 180-dimensional custom embeddings combining code structure + semantics
- Multi-language AST analysis (JS, TS, Python, C++, Java)
- SQLite-based relationship graph with strength metrics
- Smart context selection (relevant code + patterns + conventions)

**Reproducibility:**
- Open source: https://github.com/kapil0x/ai-terminal
- Test data included: `real-test-results-*.json`
- Protocol: `real-testing-protocol.js`

**Applications:**
- Architectural understanding for complex codebases
- Context-aware code suggestions
- Pattern-based refactoring recommendations
- Security vulnerability detection with specificity

**Discussion Points:**
1. How much should AI tools rely on local vs cloud processing?
2. What's the optimal embedding dimension for code semantics?
3. Can architectural pattern detection be improved with graph neural networks?

**Future Work:**
- Custom fine-tuned models for code understanding
- Graph neural networks for relationship modeling
- Integration with existing ML pipelines

Interested in feedback from the ML community, especially on the embedding approach and evaluation methodology.

**Title:** Built an AI assistant that actually understands your React/Node.js architecture

**Body:**

Frustrated with AI tools that suggest code without understanding your project? I built AI Terminal - it learns your architecture patterns and gives specific, contextual advice.

**Example - Before vs After:**

**Copilot/ChatGPT:** "Add error handling to this component"

**AI Terminal:** "Line 34: Missing error boundary for async operation. Consider ErrorBoundary pattern like components/auth/LoginForm.jsx:67. Add try-catch in useEffect hook, current complexity score: 6/10."

**How it works:**
1. Analyzes your codebase with local ML (CodeT5 embeddings)
2. Understands React patterns, Node.js architecture, component relationships
3. Gives specific line numbers and references to existing patterns
4. Learns your team's conventions over time

**What it detects:**
- React patterns (HOCs, render props, hooks, context)
- Node.js architecture (middleware, routes, models)
- Design patterns (Factory, Observer, Strategy)
- Cross-component relationships
- Performance bottlenecks with specific locations

**Real performance data:**
- 120% better than Claude Code in testing
- 1100% more actionable advice (line numbers vs generic suggestions)
- Understands your project structure, not just individual files

**Getting started:**
```bash
npm install -g ai-terminal
aiterm config  # Add your API key (Groq/OpenAI)
aiterm embed-learn  # Analyze your project
aiterm ask "optimize this React component"
```

**Privacy:** Code analysis happens locally, only relevant context sent to cloud

**GitHub:** https://github.com/kapil0x/ai-terminal (includes real test results)

Perfect for:
- Large React applications with complex state management
- Node.js APIs with multiple services
- Teams that want AI to follow their patterns
- Anyone tired of generic "add error handling" advice

Thoughts? What AI coding challenges do you face in your projects?

## r/reactjs

**Title:** AI that understands React patterns and component relationships (open source)

**Body:**

I built an AI coding assistant specifically designed to understand React architecture. Unlike generic tools, it learns your component patterns and gives specific, contextual advice.

**React-specific features:**
- Detects component patterns (HOCs, render props, custom hooks)
- Understands React Context usage and prop drilling
- Maps component relationships and state flow
- Identifies performance opportunities (useMemo, useCallback, React.memo)
- Suggests patterns based on your existing code

**Example analysis:**
```
ðŸ”¬ Component Analysis: UserProfile.jsx

**Performance Issues**
Line 23: Expensive calculation in render, consider useMemo
Line 45: New object created on each render, extract to useCallback
Similar optimization in components/Dashboard.jsx:67

**Patterns Detected**  
Higher-Order Component pattern (withAuth wrapper)
Custom hook for data fetching (useUserData)
Context consumer pattern (UserContext)

**Architecture Suggestions**
Line 78: Props drilling detected, consider UserContext like auth/AuthProvider.jsx
Line 92: State lifted too high, move to UserProfile level
```

**Technical approach:**
- Local ML embeddings understand React semantics
- AST analysis for component structure and relationships  
- Pattern detection for HOCs, hooks, context usage
- Performance analysis with specific line references

**Installation:**
```bash
npm install -g ai-terminal
aiterm config
aiterm embed-learn  # Analyzes your React app
aiterm analyze-code src/components/UserProfile.jsx
```

**Real results:** 120% better performance than Claude Code in testing

**GitHub:** https://github.com/kapil0x/ai-terminal

**Works great for:**
- Large React applications with complex component trees
- Teams wanting AI to follow their established patterns
- Performance optimization with specific recommendations
- Refactoring suggestions based on existing architecture

Anyone else frustrated with AI tools that don't understand React patterns? This is specifically built to solve that problem.

## r/node

**Title:** AI assistant that understands Node.js architecture and Express patterns

**Body:**

Built an AI tool that actually understands Node.js project structure - middleware chains, route organization, database patterns, etc. No more generic "add error handling" advice.

**Node.js specific intelligence:**
- Express middleware patterns and order
- Route organization and RESTful design
- Database query optimization (SQL/NoSQL)
- Authentication/authorization flows
- Microservice communication patterns

**Example output:**
```
ðŸ”¬ Analysis: auth/middleware.js

**Security Issues**
Line 34: JWT verification without rate limiting
Consider middleware chain like api/v1/routes.js:12
Add express-rate-limit before authentication

**Architecture Patterns**
Middleware composition pattern detected
Strategy pattern in passport configuration  
Factory pattern for database connections

**Performance Optimizations**
Line 67: Synchronous crypto operation blocking event loop
Use crypto.scrypt with promisify like utils/password.js:23
Consider connection pooling for database (current: 1 connection)
```

**How it works:**
- Analyzes your Node.js codebase structure
- Understands Express app organization, middleware chains
- Maps database relationships and query patterns  
- Detects authentication flows and security patterns
- Learns your team's conventions (naming, organization, etc.)

**Perfect for:**
- Express.js APIs with complex middleware
- Microservice architectures  
- Database-heavy applications
- Authentication/authorization systems
- Performance optimization needs

**Installation:**
```bash
npm install -g ai-terminal
aiterm config
aiterm embed-learn  # Analyzes your Node.js project
aiterm ask "optimize this API endpoint"
```

**Technical details:**
- Local ML embeddings for semantic understanding
- AST analysis for architectural patterns
- Real performance testing (120% better than Claude Code)
- Privacy-first (code analysis happens locally)

**GitHub:** https://github.com/kapil0x/ai-terminal

The difference between generic AI advice and tool that understands Node.js architecture is huge. Finally have an AI that gets Express patterns, middleware composition, and Node.js best practices.

What Node.js challenges do you face that generic AI tools can't solve?
