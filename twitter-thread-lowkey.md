## Option 1: Technical Focus
```
üßµ Been working on a side project to solve a frustrating problem with AI coding tools.

The issue: AI gives generic advice because it doesn't understand your actual codebase structure.

So I built something that analyzes your project locally first, then uses that for smarter AI interactions. 1/6

The approach:
‚Ä¢ Parse AST to understand classes, functions, relationships
‚Ä¢ Build local embeddings of your code (CodeT5 when available)  
‚Ä¢ Create semantic search index of project patterns
‚Ä¢ Use this context for AI responses instead of sending raw files 2/6

Example difference:
‚ùå Generic: "Add input validation"
‚úÖ Context-aware: "Use validateEmail() from UserValidator.js:23 like in registration.js:45"

It actually references your existing code patterns. 3/6

Technical stack:
‚Ä¢ Node.js CLI + VS Code extension
‚Ä¢ Transformers.js for local ML
‚Ä¢ SQLite for persistent project knowledge
‚Ä¢ Supports Groq/OpenAI APIs

Works with JS/TS, Python, C++, Java 4/6

Still rough around the edges, but it's been helpful for my projects. The local analysis approach feels promising.

GitHub: https://github.com/kapil0x/ai-terminal

```bash
npm install -g ai-terminal
aiterm embed-learn  # learns your codebase
aiterm ask "optimize this component"
``` 5/6

Curious if others have tried similar approaches or see value in local analysis + AI rather than just cloud-based tools.

Happy to discuss the technical implementation or get feedback! 6/6

## Option 2: Problem-First Approach  
```
üßµ Real talk: AI coding tools frustrate me.

They suggest "add error handling" without knowing I already have an ErrorHandler class.

They recommend patterns I'm already using.

They don't understand my project's architecture.

So I built something different. 1/5

The idea: Analyze code structure locally FIRST, then use AI.

‚Ä¢ Parse AST to map classes, functions, dependencies
‚Ä¢ Build semantic understanding of your codebase  
‚Ä¢ Send relevant context to AI, not entire files
‚Ä¢ Get suggestions that reference your actual code 2/5

Example:
Instead of "use try-catch"
‚Üí "Use ErrorHandler.logAndNotify() from utils/errors.js:15 like in auth/login.js:42"

It knows your existing patterns. 3/5

Built as CLI + VS Code extension:
```bash
aiterm embed-learn  # learns your project
aiterm ask "how should I handle errors here?"
aiterm review myfile.js --template security
```

GitHub: https://github.com/kapil0x/ai-terminal 4/5

Still polishing it, but the local analysis approach feels right. 

Curious what others think - is this a real problem worth solving? 5/5
```

## Option 3: Developer Story
```
üßµ Small rant about AI coding tools, then something I built to fix it.

The problem: I'm working on a Node.js API. AI suggests "add rate limiting."

But I already HAVE rate limiting. In middleware/rateLimiter.js.

AI doesn't know this because it analyzes files in isolation. 1/4

So I built a tool that learns your codebase first:

‚Ä¢ Scans project to understand structure
‚Ä¢ Maps relationships between files  
‚Ä¢ Uses this context for AI interactions
‚Ä¢ Gives suggestions based on YOUR actual code 2/4

Now when I ask about rate limiting, it says:
"Your rateLimiter.js already handles this. Consider applying it to the new endpoint like in routes/auth.js:23"

Much better. 3/4

CLI + VS Code extension:
GitHub: https://github.com/kapil0x/ai-terminal

```bash
aiterm embed-learn  
aiterm ask "how should I structure this feature?"
```

Still experimenting, but local analysis + AI feels like the right direction. 4/4
